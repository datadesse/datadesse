I am passionate about maths, statistics, physics and technology. I like finding solutions to challenging problems to make the world a better place. With my initiatives,I have helped my local community by running and managing a coding club and teaching maths. I am confident that my programming language, data analysis skills and mathematics and statistics knowledge enable me to be a good data analyst or data scientist.

I related my first project  [UK Broadband Speed Analysis](https://github.com/datadesse/UK_Broadband_Speed_Analysis) with my work experiences with local people's problems to  identify UK countries and regions affected by low broadband speed.
